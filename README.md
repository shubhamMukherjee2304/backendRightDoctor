‚öôÔ∏è People Manager Backend (Node.js & MongoDB)
‚ú® Overview
Welcome to the People Manager Backend! This project provides a robust and scalable RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js, designed to manage person data. It uses MongoDB as its primary data store, offering a flexible NoSQL solution for storing and retrieving person records.

This API serves as the data backbone for the People Manager Frontend (Angular 7/8) application, enabling full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

üåü Features
RESTful API Design: Clean and standard RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations.

MongoDB Integration: Uses Mongoose ODM for easy interaction with MongoDB, ensuring data consistency and validation.

Person Data Management:

Create: Add new person records.

Read: Retrieve single person records or a list of all people.

Update: Modify existing person records.

Delete: Remove person records from the database.

Data Model: Manages Person entities with fields for Name, Age, Gender, and Mobile Number.

Validation: Basic server-side validation for incoming data (e.g., required fields, data types).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: A NoSQL document database for flexible data storage.

Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the backend API up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: (LTS version recommended)

npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

MongoDB: A running instance of MongoDB. You can install it locally, use Docker, or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/people-manager-backend.git
cd people-manager-backend

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Environment Configuration:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/people_db

PORT: The port on which the server will run.

MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB connection string. Adjust localhost:27017/people_db if your MongoDB instance is elsewhere or your database name is different.

Running the API Server
To start the server:

npm start
# or
node server.js # (or whatever your main entry file is, e.g., app.js, index.js)

The API server will start on the port specified in your .env file (default: http://localhost:3000).

üåê API Endpoints
The API exposes the following RESTful endpoints under the /api prefix (e.g., http://localhost:3000/api/person).

Person Model Structure:
{
  "_id": "string",        // Auto-generated by MongoDB, returned on fetch/create/update
  "name": "string",       // Required
  "age": "number",        // Required
  "gender": "string",     // Required, e.g., "Male", "Female", "Other"
  "mobileNumber": "string" // Required, digits only
}
